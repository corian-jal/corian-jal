- Hello! My name is Coriander and I am currently a third year CS student at university.
- I am taking the next step in my CS education by working on my own projects!
- The languages I have the most experience with are C and C++ but I am looking to expand by language library with other useful languages.
- My goals, at least in the short term, are to work on projects that interest me and move from CLI to more user-friendly interfaces.
- Once I configure the testing for the personal project I am currently working on, I hope to make its further development public.
- Feel free to reach out if you have an advice or promising projects! Thank you c:
